# Learning Unanswerable Questions for Machine Reading Comprehension via Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning

This repository contains the code implementation for the paper titled "Learning Unanswerable Questions for Machine Reading Comprehension via Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning". In this paper, we address the challenging task of machine reading comprehension (MRC) with unanswerable questions. We propose a novel approach, AF-MRC-U, which leverages cross-lingual transfer learning to enable MRC models to handle unanswerable questions even in languages with limited training data.
